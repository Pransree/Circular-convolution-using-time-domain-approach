# Circular-convolution-using-time-domain-approach
This MATLAB code performs circular convolution of two input sequences using both a user-defined method and the built-in cconv function. It zero-pads the sequences, computes convolution via circular shifting, and displays the results with stem plots for input, impulse response, and the circular convolution output.
